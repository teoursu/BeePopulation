# BeePopulation

This study explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for analyzing and classifying the health of bee populations, a crucial aspect of ecological research and conservation. Employing advanced image-processing AI techniques, the research focuses on the development and implementation of two CNN models â€“ a baseline model and an augmented model. The models are trained and tested on a dataset comprising various bee health conditions, with the goal of accurately identifying and categorizing these conditions based on visual indicators. The report presents a detailed analysis of the models' performance, including both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Results indicate that while the baseline model achieves commendable accuracy, the augmented model shows improved performance in classifying complex health conditions. The study highlights the successes and limitations of the CNN approach, offering insights into bee population behavior and the potential of AI in ecological monitoring.
